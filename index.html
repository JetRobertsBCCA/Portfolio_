  <h2 class="first"><a href="#intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p> My name is Noah "Jet" Roberts, I am a graduate of The University of Mississippi, with a BA in Forensic Psychology. I also completed The Base Camp Coding Academy, where I took on the role as a coding apprentice, becoming proficient in many coding languages. I bring knowledge from the psychology field, using it to boost my programs' effectiveness and the ability for users to understand it without any hassle. </p>
  <p> I have a strong personal interest in 3D printing, exemplified by my ownership of a Prusa Mini. This impressive machine has significantly inspired me to delve deeper into computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D modeling. As I engage with these technologies, I find immense satisfaction in continually expanding my skill set and staying on top of the latest developments in the tech world, which occupies a substantial portion of my free time.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I have a keen interest in video game design. The prospect of creating a video game—whether for profit or purely as a means of enhancing my learning experience—greatly excites me. I am eager to explore the various facets of game development, from concept to execution, and I view this ambition as an opportunity not only to hone my technical abilities but also to express my creativity. </p>
  
  <h2><a href="#skills" id="skills">My Coding Skills</a></h2>
  <p> During my time at BCCA, I developed a comprehensive skill set in full-stack development and database management through hands-on experience with dynamic projects. These projects involved working with various languages and frameworks, including Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Spring, alongside development tools such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, and PgAdmin. I effectively applied project management methodologies to lead and execute projects, ensuring collaboration, clear communication, and efficient problem-solving. Upon completion, I earned a Certificate of Apprenticeship from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Apprenticeship, recognizing my achievements. </p>
  <p> Building on this foundation, I continue to refine my skills by exploring advanced development concepts and staying current with emerging technologies. I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, focusing on improving both the technical and collaborative aspects of my work. Whether through personal projects or professional endeavors, I am committed to growing as a developer and contributing innovative solutions to complex problems. This ongoing journey reinforces my passion for technology and drives my ambition to excel in the ever-evolving field of software development. </p>
